Final Year Project - Musivents: 

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive web app that is designed to 
enhance the user’s overall music experience. The project aims to develop a web 
app that serves as a central platform where users can easily explore, discover,
and engage with local music events.

The project integrates geographic information systems to display and map local 
event locations as well as offer interactive features for the user. 

The web app priorities user experience and creates an engaging and user-friendly environment by offering an intuitive, easy-to use and responsive 
interface for effortless navigation and exploration catering for all types of users. 

The desired outcome of the project is to produce an application that benefits its
users’ music experience while encouraging greater involvement in their local 
community. 

Overall, the Musivents web app endeavours to provide a holistic and enjoyable 
experience for all listeners of music to connect with their local music scene
